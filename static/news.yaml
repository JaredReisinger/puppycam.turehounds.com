    #### Happy New Year's!

    [All five of the puppies are now at 2 pounds](/stats), and {blue}(Beatrix) and {green}(George) are well on their way towards 2 ½ pounds.  They are all getting _much_ better at moving around, paying very little heed to the obstacles we put in their pen.

    We are starting to see more individual personality, although it's still difficult to separate their _actual_ personalities from what we're projecting onto them.  The more active they become, the easier it will be to do so, and the more we'll be able to share.  Suffice it to say, they are _all_ going to be fun puppies to raise!

    #### Eyes and environs

    As of yesterday, __*all*__ of the puppies have opened their eyes.  And, since they are all getting much bigger, they got a "puppy condo" upgrade to give them—and Hedy!—more room.  There are some new things they get to interact with as well:

    - **Litter pan:** Basenjis are a notoriously self-cleaning breed, and they do not like to soil the area they live/play in. They will seek out the litter pan (placed in the far edge/corner of their pen) to go potty, once they figure out that's what it's for.

    - **"Puppy chaos":** We've added new surfaces and obstacles in the pen to give them something more interesting and challenging than flat hospital pads. This helps them improve their coordination, and also begins to teach them that sometimes things feel and look different, and that's okay.

    With their eyes open, and starting to figure out how to _stand_ on legs, the puppies are going to become a lot more interesting and fun... and more of a challenge to keep up with. And on top of all of that, both {blue}(Beatrix) and {green}(George) have now hit a full 2 pounds, with the others not that far behind.  Cumulatively, the puppies total just under 10 pounds, making them more than one-half of a pre-pregnant Hedy!

    #### Peepers!!!

    As of this morning, {blue}(Beatrix's) and {green}(George's) eyes are beginning to open, and we expect {red}(Rye's) to open later today as well!  {yellow}(Yarrow) and {white}(Wren) are sure to follow soon; maybe not by tomorrow, but probably by the end of their second full week.

    Their sight will be blurry and unfocused for a bit, but they will quickly get much better at navigating their world.  This also marks the preamble of the never-ending "arms race" between their desire to climb and explore, and our desire to keep them safe and _not_ wandering loose around the house.  Fortunately, we've learned a few tricks from the last couple of litters, and these puppies have to start from scratch.  (As long as Hedy doesn't give them any pointers, anyway.)

    #### Merry Christmas, puppies!

    Rather than leave the house—and the puppies—to spend some Christmas-day time with friends, we had everyone over for food, fun, and puppies.  The puppies had the opportunity to meet at least half-a-dozen folks who'd never seen them before.  (Only a few at a time, and with breaks in between.)  Hedy was very proud to show off her kiddos, and to receive compliments at how good they all looked.

    #### Outgrowing the ric-rac!

    The pups have outgrown the simple ric-rac ribbons we've used as collars since their birth.  We could simply use new, larger ric-rac collars, but one added benefit of the collars—besides identifying the pups—is that having them on starts to acclimate the puppies to the _feeling_ of having a collar on.  To keep that going, they now have lightweight slip-cord collars, another step towards a "real" buckle collar.  By the time they graduate to real collars, they won't mind them at all.
    
    A lot of what we're doing with the puppies as they grow is designed to help them thrive in the human world: hearing odd and sudden noises; meeting people of different ages, appearances, and behaviors; dealing with frustration and learning to problem-solve; and so on.  One of the things that our four-legged companions have to deal with on a regular basis is wearing a collar.  We've seen puppies that haven't ever worn anything remotely like a collar _completely panic_ the first time someone puts one on them.  We don't want _any_ bad associations with collars at all... for our dogs, wearing a collar is always a good thing; it means it's time for a walk, or a fun trip out and about.

    You might notice that {white}(Wren) still has a ric-rac collar... the slip-cord collars came as a 10-pack with two of each color... but _somebody_ chewed through the white collar in the previous litter, and we used the second one as a replacement.  Who was {white}(white) in the previous litter? It's _this_ litter's momma, Hedy!  Coincidence?  Who knows?

    #### Still growing like weeds!

    It's been fun to watch the puppies continue to grow and get stronger.  They climb over each other, over Hedy's neck, shove their way in beside their siblings to nurse... just imagine what they'll get up to once their eyes are open!  That's the next major developmental milestone we're looking for, and should happen within this next week.

    You'll note that we decided to go ahead and remove the pig-rail.  This gives Hedy a bit more room, which leaves a bit more room for the puppies as well.  Every once in a while you'll see a puppy "behind" Hedy; but fear not, they are no longer at risk of getting squished; they are about 14.5%—or between 1/6th and 1/7th—of her weight.

    #### It's been a whole week!

    It's hard to believe the puppies are already a week old.  They have all [more than doubled from their birth weight](/stats), and are getting stronger as well.  Even with their eyes still closed, they are much faster to find Hedy when it's time to eat.

    From this point on, it becomes much less critical to weigh them daily.  We will continue to weigh them anyway, because it's an additional piece of information about their health and development, but missing an occasional day won't matter too much.

    Another corollary to their growth is that it's time for us to start thinking about either raising or removing the pig-rail in the whelping pen.  We are much less worried that Hedy might accidentally squish them, _and_ they are now big enough that they can actually start to get stuck behind the pig-rail itself!

  12-21T22:00: |
    #### Six days old!

    Every puppy has crossed the one-pound threshold, and has basically already [doubled its birth weight, one day ahead of schedule](/stats)!  {blue}(Beatrix) and {green}(George) keep jockeying for first place—she has first-born advantage, and he has the "boys tend to be bigger" advantage. They are _all_ excellent eaters, and Hedy has been an absolutely amazing mother!

  12-20T10:00: |
    #### Still growing like weeds!

    After four days of sleeping and nursing, the puppies [are getting ever closer to one pound each](/stats), and definitely on track to double their birth weight by the end of the first week.  Hedy continues to be a very good momma, making sure to keep them clean and fed like pro.

    For folks not familiar with our puppy set-up: you're getting a top-down view into a [whelping pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whelping_box){target=_blank}, which is den-like enclosure where Hedy gave birth.  The pen also helps keep the puppies together, so Hedy can trust that if she leaves to eat or potty, the puppies will still be there when she returns.  We use hospital bed pads underneath to catch any biological messes; it only takes a few seconds to replace a dirty pad, and they are very easy to wash. A new pad is put down every day even if it looks clean, and we wipe the whelping pen itself as well.  Underneath about half of the pad (starting from the lower-left corner) is a heating pad set on low; if the puppies or Hedy feel cold, they will shift to that corner to warm up. 
    
    You may also notice a square of PVC pipe running a couple of inches inside the walls of the pen.  This is called a "pig-rail" or "safety-rail", and ensures that the mother can't accidentally squish a puppy against the wall of the pen when lying down.  You'll sometimes see a puppy behind/under the rail, but there is plenty enough room for them to wiggle underneath and to navigate around Hedy... usually to go nurse!

    #### Day three — early neurological stimulation begins!

    We follow the [Early Neurological Stimulation](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeding/breeder-puppy-socialization-early-neurological-stimulation/){target=_blank} protocol recommended by [Puppy Culture](https://shoppuppyculture.com/){target=_blank} and the AKC.  There is evidence to suggest that stimulating the neurological systems of puppies early in their development helps to "kick start" their neurological systems into action earlier than normal, making them more resilient to stresses later in life.

    The process itself is quick and easy: each puppy gets its feet "tickled" with a q-tip for 3-5 seconds, is held head-up, head-down and supine (on their back) for 3-5 seconds each, and finally is placed feet-down on a slightly chilled damp cloth for 3-5 seconds.  That's it!  (In fact, it's [important to _not_ extend these procedures for too long](https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/VA/VA-24-W.pdf){target=_blank}.)

    They are also getting gently handled and stroked so that they learn that it's a pleasant experience in general.  Besides, it's impossible to live in a house with puppies and _not_ want to pick them up and snuggle them!

  12-17T18:30: |
    #### Day two!

    We can already tell that {green}(George) likes to cuddle with his momma.  Several times, we've seen all of the rest of the puppies snoozing in a pile, but {green}(George) is snuggled in to Hedy's hip or neck.

    The puppies continue to grow [as expected](/stats), alternating between nursing and napping. Keep an eye out for twitching!  In adults (and us!), the brain stem suppresses involuntary muscle movement during sleep.  But the puppies' brains are developing _a lot_, and that suppression isn't really happening yet.

    In other news, we've altered the PuppyCam to get more up-close and personal with the puppies by installing an improved camera wall-coupling device.  In technical terms, we "used a longer piece of cardboard".  What really matters is that you should now have a _much_ better view of those puppies, including being able to make out their collars.

  12-16T22:20: |
    One day in, and the puppies are [on target](/stats) for their expected growth; they should double in size by the end of the first week.  They also now have their new crib names: {blue}(Beatrix), {red}(Rye), {yellow}(Yarrow), {white}(Wren), and {green}(George).

    Speaking of which: when all of the puppies are listed---as above, or in the name/color/sex/weight table---they are _always_ given in birth order.  We also use their birth order matched with AKC placement colors---first place is {blue}(blue), second place is {red}(red), third place is {yellow}(yellow), and so on---for the colored collars they wear to help us keep track of them.

    In the previous litter, we started referring to the puppies simply by color (e.g. {blue}(Miss Blue)), and later chose crib names that evoked those colors (e.g. {blue}(Blueberry)).  This time around, we've chosen crib names that start with the **same letter** as the color: {blue}(blue) &rarr; `B` &rarr; {blue}(Beatrix), {red}(red) &rarr; `R` &rarr; {red}(Rye), etc.

    Hedy was an excellent mother her first night, keeping the puppies clean, fed, and warm, and letting us know when she was ready for more food or when she needed to go outside.

    Having the PuppyCam available allows us to keep an eye on things without interrupting Hedy or the puppies.  We have a new camera setup that is a lot more stable and a lot less of a tripping hazard than we had for the previous litter, but the (current) puppy area doesn't fill the frame; don't be surprised if we move the camera much closer in the next day or two.

  12-15T20:30: |
    Over the course of a little over two hours, Hedy has given birth to five healthy puppies, and the PuppyCam is now live!

  12-12T14:50: |
    Hedy's final checkup before delivery was good, and the x-ray shows five puppies!

  10-15T12:00: |
    Mama Hedy has been bred, and we're getting things ready for our December 2024 litter of puppies!
