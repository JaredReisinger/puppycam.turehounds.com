    #### Day two!

    We can already tell that {green}(George) likes to cuddle with his momma.  Several times, we've seen all of the rest of the puppies snoozing in a pile, but {green}(George) is snuggled in to Hedy's hip or neck.

    The puppies continue to grow [as expected](/stats), alternating between nursing and napping. Keep an eye out for twitching!  In adults (and us!), the brain stem suppresses involuntary muscle movement during sleep.  But the puppies' brains are developing _a lot_, and that suppression isn't really happening yet.

    In other news, we've altered the PuppyCam to get more up-close and personal with the puppies by installing an improved camera wall-coupling device.  In technical terms, we "used a longer piece of cardboard".  What really matters is that you should now have a _much_ better view of those puppies, including being able to make out their collars.

    One day in, and the puppies are [on target](/stats) for their expected growth; they should double in size by the end of the first week.  They also now have their new crib names: {blue}(Beatrix), {red}(Rye), {yellow}(Yarrow), {white}(Wren), and {green}(George).

    Speaking of which: when all of the puppies are listed---as above, or in the name/color/sex/weight table---they are _always_ given in birth order.  We also use their birth order matched with AKC placement colors---first place is {blue}(blue), second place is {red}(red), third place is {yellow}(yellow), and so on---for the colored collars they wear to help us keep track of them.

    In the previous litter, we started referring to the puppies simply by color (e.g. {blue}(Miss Blue)), and later chose crib names that evoked those colors (e.g. {blue}(Blueberry)).  This time around, we've chosen crib names that start with the **same letter** as the color: {blue}(blue) &rarr; `B` &rarr; {blue}(Beatrix), {red}(red) &rarr; `R` &rarr; {red}(Rye), etc.

    Hedy was an excellent mother her first night, keeping the puppies clean, fed, and warm, and letting us know when she was ready for more food or when she needed to go outside.

    Having the PuppyCam available allows us to keep an eye on things without interrupting Hedy or the puppies.  We have a new camera setup that is a lot more stable and a lot less of a tripping hazard than we had for the previous litter, but the (current) puppy area doesn't fill the frame; don't be surprised if we move the camera much closer in the next day or two.

    Over the course of a little over two hours, Hedy has given birth to five healthy puppies, and the PuppyCam is now live!
