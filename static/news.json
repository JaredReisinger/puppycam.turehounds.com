        "<strong>Bigger and bigger!</strong> All of the puppies have crossed the four-pound threshold, and are continuing to grow like weeds. Serendipitously, the weather here has been nice, so they’ve had several opportunities to play outside with Gable, which is fun for all involved.  We will soon begin training them to spend time in separate kennels, which will make transitioning to their “forever homes” a lot easier, and also make future car rides and vet visits a lot more pleasant.  You will probably also see another Puppy Condo upgrade soon, with the wall panels rotated to make them a little taller, to increase the overall size a bit, and also to surround the entire enclosure with a wire “x-pen” to increase its structural strength."

        "<strong>Movin’ on up!</strong> Sorry for the decline in news and weight updates… the puppies are getting a lot more active, which means a lot more work keeping up with them, and less time and energy for “the little things”. A few days ago we increased the size of their Puppy Condo, and added larger litter pans (which are, alas, in the foreground of the eye-level camera). Their personalities are starting to develop, which makes it incredibly entertaining when they are let loose for feeding or for us to clean the Condo. Although they are still sleeping a ton—being only 1 month old, after all—it is more and more likely that you’ll catch them romping around, wrestling with each other or playing with a toy."

        "<strong>Good appetites!</strong> All of the pups have figured out how to lap goat’s milk from a shallow bowl, and they swarm it as soon as it hits the ground. Collectively, they’ll consume almost a full cup of milk in one feeding, although a not insignificant portion of that ends up on the Puppy Condo, on each other, etc. This morning, they were also introduced to little pieces of duck neck, even though they aren't <em>quite</em> ready to chew that much. To our surprise, little <span class=\"purple\">Miss Pixie Plum</span> dove right in and did her best to lick it into submission."

        "<strong>Changes, changes, changes!</strong> All of the puppies are getting the hang of using those dangling appendages otherwise known as legs. They are toddling around with much more confidence, and are quite adept at climbing over one another, especially if it means getting a step up to try to escape their containment.",
        "Poor Momma Disa is starting to show signs that nursing is becoming a bit more… abrasive. A few of the puppies are starting to exhibit their first teeth, and <span class=\"blue\">Blueberry</span> already seems to be sprouting fearsome canines! With this in mind, we’ve started to introduce them to their first not-from-momma food source: raw goat’s milk. They still aren’t quite sure what to do with the stuff, whether it’s for stepping in, or for face-planting in… but Barbara has successfully lured them from licking from her finger to lapping from a shallow bowl. We still want them to nurse as long as possible, but it’s a lot for Disa to keep up with feeding six puppies; having a supplemental food source will help everyone.",
        "Big half-brother Gable is trying to get the puppies to play, offering “play bows” and tossing his head. If he only knew what he was in for in another two weeks!",
        "Finally, between increased mobility and learning to eliminate without momma’s help, the puppies have “moved” to a bigger Puppy Condo! Instead of the whelping box, they are now in a configurable enclosure that we will adjust as they grow and develop. This gives them more room to romp and an opportunity to learn how to “keep the den clean” when they need to use the potty."
