## Why on earth does this exist?

For two reasons:

- Family, friends, and prospective new puppy owners _**love**_ to watch puppies as they grow and develop. Since we can’t have all of these people living in our house, the next best thing is a 24/7 live-stream.

- Personal software projects give me a chance to play with technologies that I’m curious about. I’ve used React quite a bit and wanted to see what Svelte/Sapper and then Svelte/SvelteKit was like.

## Okay, so what is it, exactly?

_Read more about the technical details on the [About page](https://puppycam.turehounds.com/about/) itself._

This project initially started in the days of Sapper, but has now been migrated to SvelteKit v2 and Svelte v5. _Most_ of the data reactivity is now rune-based, but there may still be some lingering pre-Svelte-5 syntax here or there.

## Can I use this?

Indeed you can, that’s why I made the repo public. You almost certainly won’t want everything as-is, but please feel free to use any of it as example code.
